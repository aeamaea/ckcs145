	Basic Architecture:
	* Use single app.py
	* Use Postgresql with pugsql pip module
	* Use bootstrap to make it "look nice" 
	* Have admin interface 
		- Login/Logout
		- Form to update the "exchange rate"
		- 



* TODOS: *
✅	- Get bootstrap template
✅	- Create flask app skeleton (just app.py? don't get too fancy!)
✅	- Use secrets file (.env) so they don't leak out to public when repo is made public
✅	- create mongo DB (jwfoods) 
	    - Created Collections ✅
	    - finish the lab11 ✅
	    - connect lab11 user/pw system to the back end ✅
	    - enhance lab11 login/logout with update of the jwfoods.Coeffs.[weight_coeff,distance_coeffs] 
		updates and stuff ✅
	    - put the login/logout (admin code) into the jwfoods app.py and make it work (WIP)
