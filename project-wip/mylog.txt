	Basic Architecture:
	* Use single app.py
	* Use Postgresql with pugsql pip module
	* Use bootstrap to make it "look nice" 
	* Have admin interface 
		- Login/Logout
		- Form to update the "exchange rate"
		- 



* TODOS: *
	- Get bootstrap template
	- Create flask app skeleton (just app.py? don't get too fancy!)
	- Use secrets file (.env) so they don't leak out to public when repo is made public
	- create Postgresql DB (project.db ??) 
	-
