tl;dr

NONE OF THE STUFF HERE IS USED FOR THE JWFOODS SITE
SEE app.js

Long and Winded:

Most of the stuff in here is deprecated. This started out as a tutorial
for doing a simple tasks app but it was too complicated to adapt to the 
jwfoods example so I ripped out the routes from here and put them
right in the app.js. All the jwfoods routes are in the app.js file.

This folder contains stuff that isn't really used but I'm keeping
the code in here just in case I need it. :: aeamaea
