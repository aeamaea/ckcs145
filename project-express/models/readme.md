tl;dr

Only the jwmodels.js is used for the jwfoods. if you look at app.js
you'll see it's being imported in there (it exposes the Coeffs collection)

L&W:

The task.js is from the original tutorial I did to understand
Express.js and it's various parts. This is not used for anything
I took out the task_routes.js from app.js so they're not reachable
but can be put in if needed. 

It's probably better to follow a different tutorial for this as I 
was just playing around here and it's not a good starting point for 
any beginners. :: aeamaea
