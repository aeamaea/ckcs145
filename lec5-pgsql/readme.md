This is the PGSQL version of the Lecture 5 mongoapp. Here I have tried to port the app from mongoDB enging to PGSQL. 
Pre-Reqs: You will definitely need SQLAlchemy, psycopg2 (use the binary version of the pip package if you're on apple silicon) and probably some other stuff (look at the imports) - YMMV
